# Data Overview
We need to pull county-level data from nass quick stats 2.0 for the following items: 
* net income (productivity) - done - 12k
* labor - done - labor - 36k 
* land - done - 15k
* machinery - done - 15k
* fertilizer - done - 15k
* fuel - done - 15k
* tractors - done - 15k
* trucks - done - 9k

## NOTE: This data was downloaded and is ready to be imported and merged. Trucks is the smallest set so use that as the baseline. We will likely later need spatial shape files too, but we're not there yet.
